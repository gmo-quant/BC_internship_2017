	<p>
	ENC1101 is a university parallel course that requires students to learn and practice writing by creating original compositions, exploring basic rhetorical forms such as narration, exposition, and argumentations. Students will also develop research skills and learn to incorporate research material through the writing process. For non- exempt students, placement in ENC1101 is determined by both standard and departmental assessment tests. Students must earn a grade of C or higher to meet the requirements of the Gordon Rule for writing. This is a writing credit course that focuses on extensive writing and revision.
